ðŸ§© Design Approach

    Each entity will have its corresponding service:
        ParkingLotService
        ParkingFloorService
        ParkingSpotService
        VehicleService
        TicketService
        PaymentService

    Each service:
        Is annotated with @Service
        Injects the corresponding repository
        Has CRUD methods and business logic (to be added later)
        Uses constructor injection (preferred for testability)
