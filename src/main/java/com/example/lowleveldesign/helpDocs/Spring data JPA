💡 What is a Repository?

        In Spring Data JPA, a Repository is a Data Access Layer (DAO) that handles all interaction between your Java objects (Entities) and the database (PostgreSQL here).
        Think of it as a bridge between your service/business logic and the database.

        🛠 Why do we need Repositories?

        Without repositories, you’d have to write SQL queries (or JPQL/HQL) manually for everything:

        SELECT * FROM parking_lot WHERE id = 1;
        INSERT INTO parking_lot VALUES (...);


        With repositories, you just call Java methods like:

        parkingLotRepository.findById(1L);
        parkingLotRepository.save(new ParkingLot(...));


Spring generates the SQL under the hood. 🚀

⚡ How does it work?
        You define an Entity → maps to a database table.
        You create a Repository interface → extends JpaRepository<Entity, IdType>.
        Spring auto-generates the implementation at runtime using Hibernate.

these are just interfaces.
The beauty of Spring Data JPA is that you don’t implement them manually — Spring Boot + Hibernate generates the implementation at runtime for you.

🔍 How does it work?
    When your app starts:
        Spring scans for all @Repository interfaces that extend JpaRepository.
        For each of them, Spring creates a proxy class (runtime implementation).
        The proxy class internally uses Hibernate EntityManager to talk to the database.

    So when you call:
        parkingLotRepository.findById(1L);


    Spring routes it like this:
        ParkingLotRepository (proxy) → EntityManager → Hibernate → PostgreSQL
