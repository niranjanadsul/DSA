ðŸ’¡ What is a Repository?

        In Spring Data JPA, a Repository is a Data Access Layer (DAO) that handles all interaction between your Java objects (Entities) and the database (PostgreSQL here).
        Think of it as a bridge between your service/business logic and the database.

        ðŸ›  Why do we need Repositories?

        Without repositories, youâ€™d have to write SQL queries (or JPQL/HQL) manually for everything:

        SELECT * FROM parking_lot WHERE id = 1;
        INSERT INTO parking_lot VALUES (...);


        With repositories, you just call Java methods like:

        parkingLotRepository.findById(1L);
        parkingLotRepository.save(new ParkingLot(...));


Spring generates the SQL under the hood. ðŸš€

âš¡ How does it work?
        You define an Entity â†’ maps to a database table.
        You create a Repository interface â†’ extends JpaRepository<Entity, IdType>.
        Spring auto-generates the implementation at runtime using Hibernate.
