     * üîπ What is Cache Coherence?
     *
         * Modern CPUs are multi-core, and each core usually has its own private cache (L1, L2)
     *      plus a shared L3 cache.
         * When multiple cores access and update the same memory location,
     *      the system must ensure that all cores see a consistent view of memory.
         * This consistency is called cache coherence.
     *
     * üîπ The Problem
     *
     *      Imagine this setup:
     *      Memory location X = 0.
     *      Core 1 and Core 2 both cache X.
     *      Core 1 writes X = 1 (in its cache).
     *      Core 2 still sees X = 0 (in its cache).
     *
     *      Now different cores disagree about the value of X ‚Üí incoherence.
     *      That would break correctness in multi-threaded programs.
     *
     * üîπ Cache Coherence Protocols
     *
     *      To avoid the above, CPUs use cache coherence protocols (hardware-level).
     *      The most common one is MESI:
     *      M = Modified ‚Üí This cache has the only copy, and it‚Äôs dirty (not yet written back to memory).
     *      E = Exclusive ‚Üí This cache has the only copy, but it‚Äôs clean (same as memory).
     *      S = Shared ‚Üí Cache line may exist in multiple caches, all clean.
     *      I = Invalid ‚Üí Cache line is invalid, must fetch from memory or another cache.
     *
     *      When a core reads or writes, the protocol ensures caches "talk to each other"
     *      (via the bus or interconnect).
     *      E.g. if Core 1 modifies X, Core 2‚Äôs copy of X will be invalidated ‚Üí next time Core 2 reads X,
     *      it fetches the updated value.
     *
     * üîπ Connection to Java (Visibility Problem)
     *
     *      This directly relates to what you asked earlier about volatile and synchronized:
     *      A write to a volatile variable in Java forces that write to be flushed to main memory and
     *      other cores‚Äô caches invalidated.
     *      A read of a volatile variable forces fetching the latest value from memory (or coherent cache).
     *      synchronized also has a happens-before guarantee that relies on these coherence mechanisms.
     *      So in short: Java concurrency is built on hardware cache coherence protocols +
     *      Java Memory Model rules.
     *
     * üîπ Simple Analogy
     *
     *      Think of 3 friends (cores) each keeping a personal notebook (cache) of the same shared
     *      to-do list (memory).
     *      If one friend crosses off a task but doesn‚Äôt tell the others, their notes will be inconsistent.
     *
     *      Cache coherence is like a rule:
     *      ‚ÄúIf one friend changes the notebook, they must either tell everyone else or force
     *      everyone to re-check the main list.‚Äù
     *
     * ‚úÖ Key Takeaway:
     *      Cache coherence ensures all cores see a consistent view of shared memory,
     *      typically using MESI protocol.
     *      Java‚Äôs volatile and synchronized rely on these hardware guarantees to implement visibility.*/
