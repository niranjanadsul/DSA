     * What is ThreadLocal?
     *
     *      A ThreadLocal<T> provides thread-local variables.
     *      Each thread that accesses the variable via get()/set() has its own independent copy.
     *      This means values stored in a ThreadLocal are not shared between threads â€”
     *      theyâ€™re bound to the thread that set them.
     *
     * ðŸ”¹ Why do we need ThreadLocal?
     *      Sometimes we need shared state per thread (not across threads).
     *      Example:
     *          Database connections per thread.
     *          User/session context in web servers.
     *          DateFormat (not thread-safe) reused safely per thread.
     *
     * ðŸ”¹ Key Methods
     *      get() â†’ fetch the value for current thread.
     *      set(T value) â†’ set value for current thread.
     *      remove() â†’ remove value (important to avoid memory leaks in long-lived threads like
     *                  thread pools).
     *      withInitial(Supplier<? extends T>) â†’ convenient way to provide default values.
     *
     * ðŸ”¹ Important Notes
     *
     *      Memory leaks risk in thread pools:
     *      If you donâ€™t call remove(), values can stick around since threads are reused.
     *      ThreadLocal is not Inheritable:
     *      By default, child threads donâ€™t inherit values.
     *      Use InheritableThreadLocal if you need that.
     *      Use case: great for context storage (like a mini per-thread global variable).*/
