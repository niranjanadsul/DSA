     * ðŸ”¹ ThreadLocal vs InheritableThreadLocal
     *
     *      ThreadLocal â†’ each thread gets its own isolated copy of the variable.
     *                      Child threads do not inherit anything from the parent.
     *
     *       InheritableThreadLocal â†’ child threads created from a parent inherit the parentâ€™s value
     *                                  at the time of their creation.
     *                                  After that, the child has its own copy
     *                                  (modifying it wonâ€™t affect the parent).
     *
     * âœ… Key Takeaways
     *      ThreadLocal â†’ isolated, no inheritance.
     *      InheritableThreadLocal â†’ child thread copies the parentâ€™s value at thread creation.
     *      After creation, parent and child values are independent
     *      (changes in one donâ€™t affect the other).*/
